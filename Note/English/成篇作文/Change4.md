Dear Jack,

As for you last letter consulting me about the origin of the name of Chang'e 4 probe,which succeeded in landing on the moon,I am delighted to tell you something associated with it.

The legend of Chang'e and her flight to the moon has been familiar to Chinese for thousands of years. It is acknowledged that not only was she the first person to set foot there but also stands for ancient people's dream of exploring the moon. That is why the probe is named after Chang'e.

Regarded as a giant leap in the development of Chinese space industry,the thrilling achievement makes us hold the firm belief that our dream will be realized in time.

I hope you will find my breif introduction helpful.

Yours,

Li Hua
