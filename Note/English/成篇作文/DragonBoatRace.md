It is a privilege for me to inform you of some relevant details with the intention of smoothing your puzzles related to this activity.

To begin with, regarded as an essential traditional custom, the Dragon Boat Race is worth watching as a visual feast. After that, it is the typical snack called zongzi that will arouse your interest in Chinese food. Eventually, what this activity will end up with is a tour to places of interest. It is beyond argument that not only will their beauty be struck into your heart but also makes your journey worthwhile.

I am convinced that you will be content with this unforgettable experience. Looking forward to your coming.

Yours,
