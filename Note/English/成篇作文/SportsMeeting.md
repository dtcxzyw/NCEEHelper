Dear Peter,

Learning that you are interested in sports,I am writing to invite you to watch the opening ceremony of our school sports meeting,whose theme is "Ancient Art and New Stage".

The grand gathering will be held at 8:00 tomorrow. At the first place we students will stare at the rising Chinese flag while singing the Chinese song. Then the athletes will enter the statium with their identities. Finally there will be some performances featuring Chinese traditional culture. What is wonderful is Taichi,a type of Chinese material arts. It is begyond argument that they will feast your eyes.

I do hope you will accept my invitation if it is convenient to you.

Yours,

LiHua
