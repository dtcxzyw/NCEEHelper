Dear Jack,

Knowing that you have difficulty learning idioms,I am writing to you with the intention of smoothing your puzzle.

To begin with,it is understandable that they are unfamiliar to you. As the phenomenon is common to beginners,you don't need to upset yourself. What is most practical for you is a handy idioms dictionary,which is convenient to consult when you meet a strange idiom. After that you are supposed to accumulate idioms by taking notes with the aim of expanding your vocabulary. Another effective method is applying what you have learnt to your chats with others. Only in this way will you deepen your understanding of them.

I do hope my suggestions will be of benefit to you. Looking forward to your improvement soon.

Yours faithfully,
